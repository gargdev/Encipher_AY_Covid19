# Encipher_AY_Covid19
This repository is dedicated to the hackathon arranged by the Innovation and Incubation Cell of BIET, Jhansi. <br>
The ongoing pandemic is a time of need and uncertainity for all.The idea behind CoviHelp app originated from the shared desire & intent of the team members to provide help in any possible form in these challenging times to the best of our abilities.This event acted as the necessary push for us to get it started. <br>  
 
The data for active, recovered and deceased cases is being fetched from an API, whereas the entire vaccination data is being fetched from the Covid helpdesk from the govt. of India.The oxygen,plasma,hospitals and other medical availability can be checked location-wise from an authentic website we are redirecting to. We will be adding a 'Precautions' section too in the app in a while for everyday precaution reminders which we could not now due to time constraint. <br>
